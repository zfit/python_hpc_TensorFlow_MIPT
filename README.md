# High Performance Computing in Python with TensorFlow and model fitting with zfit

This repository contains tutorials for the workshop at the Moscow State University about using TensorFlow for HPC in Python as well as for the statistical inference with zfit and hepstats, a model fitting library written using TensorFlow as the backend.


## Interactively using them

Either you can download them and start a Jupyter Notebook session

or you can [use binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zfit/python_hpc_TensorFlow_MSU/master)

or go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), search this respository and play around
